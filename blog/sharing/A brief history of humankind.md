### Part One Cognitive Revolution
#### 其实我们没啥特别

**Physics** is energy, time and space, fundamental features of our universe.
matter and energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called **chemistry**.
certain molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. The story of organisms is called **biology**.
organisms belonging to the speciesHomo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called **cultures**.
The subsequent development of these human cultures is called **history**.
这一段真心精彩啊！

**Three important revolutions** shaped the course of history: the Cognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago. The Agricultural Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scienti c Revolution, which got under way only 500 years ago, may well end history and start something completely di erent.

**There were humans long before there was history.** But for countless generations they did not stand out from the myriad other organisms with which they shared their habitats.  The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were insigni cant animals with no more impact on their environment than gorillas, fireflies or jellyfish. 早起的我们并没有什么优势。也不会对环境造成什么影响

Like it or not, we are members of a large and particularly noisy family called the great apes. 其实我们和动物没什么区别

Not only do we possess an abundance of uncivilised cousins, once upon a time we had quite a few brothers and sisters as well. the world was home, at one and the same time, to several human species. 所以说，我们也没有不是生来就是核心。我们也有很多的兄弟姐妹，只不过很多都灭绝了。

Despite their many di erences, all human species share several de ning characteristics. Most notably, humans have extraordinarily large brains compared to other animals.  Why is genus Homo the only one in the entire animal kingdom to have come up with such massive thinking machines? The fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. It’s not easy to carry around, especially when encased inside a massive skull. It’s even harder to fuel. Another singular human trait is that we walk upright on two legs. As a result, humans can perform very intricate tasks with their hands. In particular, they can produce and use sophisticated tools. 但是我们能存活下来，一定是有我们的道理，比如说脑子大。个人认为世界是辩证的，大也要有一个度。另一个是我们靠两条腿走路，所以省出来两只手可以干别的。

Women paid extra.
Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education.
This fact has contributed greatly both to humankind’s extraordinary social abilities and to its unique social problems. 
Raising children required constant help from other family members and neighbours. It takes a tribe to raise a human. Evolution thus favoured those capable of forming strong social ties. In addition, since humans are born underdeveloped, they can be educated and socialised to a far greater extent than any other animal. 
刚出生的人类十分脆弱，但是，这也一定程度上促进了社会的发展。同时，白纸一张，也更容易塑造。

For millions of years, humans hunted smaller creatures and gathered what they could, all the while being hunted by larger predators. It was only 400,000 years ago that several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular basis, and only in the last 100,000 years – with the rise of Homo sapiens – that man jumped to the top of the food chain.
That spectacular leap from the middle to the top had enormous consequences.
In contrast, humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was not given time to adjust. Moreover, humans themselves failed to adjust.
其实早期我们是非常脆弱的。但是，我们成长起来后，是很可怕的。不仅对其他动物，甚至环境都被改变很多。

A signi cant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire.
But the best thing  re did was cook
The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines.
By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains 
When humans domesticated  re, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force.
人类登顶重要的一步就是使用火。更多的能量补给给大脑、更多的时间思考。

In recent decades the Replacement Theory has been the common wisdom in the  eld.
It turned out that 1–4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA.
Biological reality is not black and white. There are also important grey areas. 
it appears it was still just possible, on rare occasions, for a Sapiens and a Neanderthal to produce a fertile o spring. So the populations did not merge, but a few lucky Neanderthal genes did hitch a ride on the Sapiens Express. 
One possibility is that Homo sapiens drove them to extinction.
Another possibility is that competition for resources  ared up into violence and genocide.
Whether Sapiens are to blame or not, no sooner had they arrived at a new location than the native population became extinct.
人类其他的兄弟姐妹很有可能是被我们消灭的。即使是现在，我们的杀伤力也很大。所到之处，寸草不生。

那究竟为什么我们这么厉害？The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.

#### 知识树让我们脱颖而出
But then, beginning about 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens started doing very special things
Most researchers believe that these unprecedented accomplishments were the
product of a revolution in Sapiens’ cognitive abilities.
The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using an altogether new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation. Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather than in that of Neanderthals? It was a matter of pure chance, as far as we can tell. But it’s more important to understand the consequences of the Tree of Knowledge mutation than its causes. 
What, then, is so special about our language?
The most common answer is that our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an in nite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning.
一切的进化都是突变，或者不走寻常路。

The gossip theory might sound like a joke, but numerous studies support it. 
Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.
But  ction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively.
Sapiens can cooperate in extremely  exible ways with countless numbers of strangers. That’s why Sapiens rule the world, whereas ants eat our leftovers and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.
说到语言，其他动物也有语言。但是我们的最特别，因为我们能够描述不存的东西。这些不存在东西，让我们合作、维持社会秩序、维护经济等等。

#### 描述不存在事物的重要性
Humans, like chimps, have social instincts that enabled our ancestors to form friendships and hierarchies, and to hunt or  ght together.
In the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, gossip helped Homo sapiens to form larger and more stable bands. But even gossip has its limits. Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals.
The secret was probably the appearance of  ction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.
实际中确实如此，我们能够维护的关系有限。

其实我们生活中绝大部分都是靠虚幻出来的东西维持。
Peugeot is a  gment of our collective imagination. Lawyers call this a ‘legal  ction’. It can’t be pointed at; it is not a physical object. But it exists as a legal entity. 
Telling e ective stories is not easy. The di culty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it.
Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations.

####语言克服了基因传递的部分不足
The ability to create an imagined reality out of words enabled large numbers of strangers to cooperate e ectively. But it also did something more.
The behaviour of other social animals is determined to a large extent by their genes. DNA is not an autocrat. Animal behaviour is also in uenced by environmental factors and individual quirks.
For similar reasons, archaic humans did not initiate any revolutions. As far as we can tell, changes in social patterns, the invention of new technologies and the settlement of alien habitats resulted from genetic mutations and environmental pressures more than from cultural initiatives. This is why it took humans hundreds of thousands of years to make these steps.
In contrast, ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have been able to change their behaviour quickly, transmitting new behaviours to future generations without any need of genetic or environmental change. 
In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained  xed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two. 
This was the key to Sapiens’ success.
我们能够成功，一个重要的因素是我们的语言，帮助我们合作。因此我们受环境的影响也最值降低。

#### 认知革命来的变化

| New ability                              | Wider consequences                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| The ability to transmit larger quantities of information about the world surrounding Homo sapiens | Planning and carrying out complex actions, such as avoiding lions and hunting bison |
| The ability to transmit larger quantities of information about Sapiens social relationships | Larger and more cohesive groups, numbering up to 150 individuals |
| The ability to transmit information about things that do not really exist, such as tribal spirits, nations, limited liability companies, and human rights | a. Cooperation between very large numbers of strangers b. Rapid innovation of social behaviour |

#### 历史？生物？
The immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented, and the resulting diversity of behaviour patterns, are the main components of what we call ‘cultures’. Once cultures appeared, they never ceased to change and develop, and these unstoppable alterations are what we call ‘history’.
This does not mean that Homo sapiens and human culture became exempt from biological laws. 
我们又了认知，可以降低环境的影响。但是一些生物规律我们同要要遵守。

It is, however, a mistake to look for the di erences at the level of the individual or the family. One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Signi cant di erences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the di erences are astounding.
Of course, we also needed other skills, such as the ability to make and use tools. Yet tool-making is of little consequence unless it is coupled with the ability to cooperate with many others.
However, our capacity to cooperate with large numbers of strangers has improved dramatically.
虽然我们在个体上差异不大，但是总体，宏观的来看，就是另一回事。

To summarise the relationship between biology and history after the Cognitive Revolution:
a. Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.
b. However, this arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent  ction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each generation develops and elaborates even further.
c. Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions. Referring only to our biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who, attending the World Cup football championships, o ers his listeners a detailed description of the playing  eld rather than an account of what the players are doing.
认知革命后，在基因的大背景下，人们自身的认识发挥巨大作用。

#### 亚当夏娃的一天
The  ourishing  eld of evolutionary psychology argues that many of our present-day social and psychological characteristics were shaped during this long pre-agricultural era.
This environment gives us more material resources and longer lives than those enjoyed by any previous generation, but it often makes us feel alienated, depressed and pressured.
The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard- wired into our genes. Today we may be living in high-rise apartments with over- stu ed refrigerators, but our DNA still thinks we are in the savannah
所以说，追求高热量的东西，是本能。

the vast majority of people lived in small bands numbering several dozen or at most several hundred individuals, and that all these individuals were humans. It is important to note this last point, because it is far from obvious. Most members of agricultural and industrial societies are domesticated animals. 
There was just one exception to this general rule: the dog. The dog was the  rst animal domesticated by Homo sapiens, and this occurred before the Agricultural Revolution. 
现代社会，给我们吃的动物估计远远多过人类

Members of a band knew each other very intimately, and were surrounded throughout their lives by friends and relatives.
Such cooperation was one of the important trademarks of Homo sapiens, and gave it a crucial edge over other human species.
Trade was mostly limited to prestige items such as shells, amber and pigments. There is no evidence that people traded staple goods like fruits and meat, or that the existence of one band depended on the importing of goods from another.
Occasionally, bands wandered outside their turf and explored new lands, whether due to natural calamities, violent con icts, demographic pressures or the initiative of a charismatic leader. These wanderings were the engine of human worldwide expansion.
合作，扩张。

But at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skilful people in history.
There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging.
The forager economy provided most people with more interesting lives than agriculture or industry do. 
Evidence from fossilised skeletons indicates that ancient foragers were less likely to su er from starvation or malnutrition, and were generally taller and healthier than their peasant descendants.
The foragers’ secret of success, which protected them from starvation and malnutrition, was their varied diet.
Ancient foragers also su ered less from infectious diseases.
The wholesome and varied diet, the relatively short working week, and the rarity of infectious diseases have led many experts to de ne pre-agricultural forager societies as ‘the original a uent societies’. 
那个时候，都是靠口口相传。所以老者知识多，那个时候认为什么都知道。现在科技发展，我们开始承认不知道很多事情。正是这种转变，让我们在最近几百年进步神速。当然那个时候，人们的单体战斗力也要比现在厉害。

Most scholars agree that animistic beliefs were common among ancient
foragers. Animism (from ‘anima’, ‘soul’ or ‘spirit’ in Latin) is the belief that almost every place, every animal, every plant and every natural phenomenon has awareness and feelings, and can communicate directly with humans.
Animists believe that there is no barrier between humans and other beings. They can all communicate directly through speech, song, dance and ceremony. 
The theories of scholars who claim to know what the foragers felt shed much more light on the prejudices of their authors than on Stone Age religions.
The second explanation is that by the time Sapiens reached Australia, they had already mastered  re agriculture.
A third explanation agrees that hunting and  re agriculture played a signi cant role in the extinction, but emphasises that we can’t completely ignore the role of climate. 

#### 认知革命带来的破坏
Following the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens acquired the technology, the organisational skills, and perhaps even the vision necessary to break out of Afro- Asia and settle the Outer World.
The settlers of Australia, or more accurately, its conquerors, didn’t just adapt, they transformed the Australian ecosystem beyond recognition.
Some scholars try to exonerate our species, placing the blame on the vagaries of the climate (the usual scapegoat in such cases). Yet it is hard to believe that Homo sapiens was completely innocent.
All the settlers of Australia had at their disposal was Stone Age technology. How could they cause an ecological disaster? There are three explanations that mesh quite nicely.
Large animals – the primary victims of the Australian extinction – breed slowly.
But why did they bother? Why banish oneself to Siberia by choice? Perhaps some bands were driven north by wars, demographicpressures or natural disasters. Others might have been lured northwards by more positive reasons, such as animal protein.

### Part Two Agricultural Revolution

#### 历史上最大的欺骗
All this changed about 10,000 years ago, when Sapiens began to devote almost all their time and e ort to manipulating the lives of a few animal and plant species. From sunrise to sunset humans sowed seeds, watered plants, plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to prime pastures. This work, they thought, would provide them with more fruit, grain and meat. It was a revolution in the way humans lived – the Agricultural Revolution.
这就是农业革命。

Even today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90 per cent of the calories that feed humanity come from the handful of plants that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC – wheat, rice, maize (called ‘corn’ in the US), potatoes, millet and barley. Today, scholars agree that agriculture sprang up in other parts of the world not by the action of Middle Eastern farmers exporting their revolution but entirely independently.
这些农业的发展是多地同时进行的，而且影响至今。

Those few species lived in particular places, and those are the places where agricultural revolutions occurred. As soon as this happened, they cheerfully abandoned the gruelling, dangerous, and often spartan life of hunter-gatherers, settling down to enjoy the pleasant, satiated life of farmers.
这句诗历史，少数的特殊派带来变革。

Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more di cult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud. The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes. These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.
这就是有意思的地方，食物，通俗来讲，很多食物控制了人类，而不是人类控制了它们。

Wheat did not give people economic security. The life of a peasant is less secure than that of a hunter-gatherer. Nor could wheat o er security against human violence. The early farmers were at least as violent as their forager ancestors, if not more so. Village life certainly brought the  rst farmers some immediate bene ts, such as better protection against wild animals, rain and cold. Yet for the average person, the disadvantages probably outweighed the advantages. Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled Homo sapiens to multiply exponentially. 
固定的饮食结果，极大的威胁到人类的生活稳定性。为了稳定，人们不得不耕种更多。甚至抢夺。

The rise of farming was a very gradual affair spread over centuries and millennia. A band of Homo sapiens gathering mushrooms and nuts and hunting deer and rabbit did not all of a sudden settle in a permanent village, ploughing  elds, sowing wheat and carrying water from the river. The change proceeded by stages, each of which involved just a small alteration in daily life.  With the move to permanent villages and the increase in food supply, the population began to grow. With time, the ‘wheat bargain’ became more and more burdensome. Children died in droves, and adults ate bread by the sweat of their brows. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. The  rst part of the plan went smoothly. People indeed worked harder. But people did not foresee that the number of children would increase, meaning that the extra wheat would have to be shared between more children. Neither did the early farmers understand that feeding children with more porridge and less breast milk would weaken their immune system, and that permanent settlements would be hotbeds for infectious diseases. They did not foresee that by increasing their dependence on a single source of food, they were actually exposing themselves even more to the depredations of drought. Nor did the farmers foresee that in good years their bulging granaries would tempt thieves and enemies, compelling them to start building walls and doing guard duty. Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. The pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship, and not for the last time. One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for
granted. 
部落的生产是一个缓慢的过程，但是，结果无疑是让生活更加艰难。

The story of the luxury trap carries with it an important lesson. Humanity’s search for an easier life released immense forces of change that transformed the world in ways nobody envisioned or wanted. 
一旦获得奢华，难以回退。于是，我们往往被奢华所控制。

Maybe it wasn’t the search for an easier life that brought about the transformation. Maybe Sapiens had other aspirations, and were consciously willing to make their lives harder in order to achieve them.
或许我们本来就是要挑战自己。

With each passing generation, the sheep became fatter, more submissive and less curious. In most farming societies people focused on plant cultivation; raising animals was a secondary activity. But a new kind of society also appeared in some places, based primarily on the exploitation of animals: tribes of pastoralist herders. Unfortunately, the evolutionary perspective is an incomplete measure of success. It judges everything by the criteria of survival and reproduction, with no regard for individual su ering and happiness. This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual su ering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution.
很不幸。人类的需求往往是其他生物的不行。

#### 建造农业社会的金字塔

当我们习惯了农业生活时，我们就难以回到过去。
While agricultural space shrank, agricultural time expanded. Foragers usually didn’t waste much time thinking about next week or next month. Farmers sailed in their imagination years and decades into the future.
The Agricultural Revolution made the future far more important than it had ever been before. Farmers must always keep the future in mind and must work in its service. The agricultural economy was based on a seasonal cycle of production, comprising long months of cultivation followed by short peak periods of harvest.
Peasants were worried about the future not just because they had more cause for worry, but also because they could do something about it.

我们设想的秩序，以维持我们生存
The food surpluses produced by peasants, coupled with new transportation technology, eventually enabled more and more people to cram together  rst into large villages, then into towns, and  nally into cities, all of them joined together by new kingdoms and commercial networks.
When the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires, people invented stories about great gods, motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social links. While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail’s pace, the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any other ever seen on earth.
All these cooperation networks – from the cities of ancient Mesopotamia to the Qin and Roman empires – were ‘imagined orders’. The social norms that sustained them were based neither on ingrained instincts nor on personal acquaintances, but rather on belief in shared myths.
It is easy for us to accept that the division of people into ‘superiors’ and commoners’ is a  gment of the imagination. Yet the idea that all humans are equal is also a myth.
Evolution is based on di erence, not on equality. Every person carries a somewhat di erent genetic code, and is exposed from birth to di erent environmental in uences. This leads to the development of di erent qualities that carry with them di erent chances of survival.
Equally, there are no such things as rights in biology. There are only organs, abilities and characteristics.

一些我们难以接受的真理
If people realise that human rights exist only in the imagination, isn’t there a danger that our society will collapse?
A natural order is a stable order. There is no chance that gravity will cease to function tomorrow, even if people stop believing in it. In contrast, an imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon myths, and myths vanish once people stop believing in them.
However, an imagined order cannot be sustained by violence alone. It requires some true believers as well.

How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined. You also educate people thoroughly. 

#### 超负荷的记录
The large societies found in some other species, such as ants and bees, are stable and resilient because most of the information needed to sustain them is encoded in the genome. 
Because the Sapiens social order is imagined, humans cannot preserve the critical information for running it simply by making copies of their DNA and passing these on to their progeny. A conscious e ort has to be made to sustain laws, customs, procedures and manners, otherwise the social order would quickly collapse.
For millions of years people stored information in a single place – their brains. Unfortunately, the human brain is not a good storage device for empire-sized databases, for three main reasons. irst, its capacity is limited. Secondly, humans die, and their brains die with them. Any information stored in a brain will be erased in less than a century. Thirdly and most importantly, the human brain has been adapted to store and process only particular types of information. But when particularly complex societies began to appear in the wake of the
Agricultural Revolution, a completely new type of information became vital – numbers.
我们有更多的认识，这些都是脱离于基因，依靠扣扣相传流传至今。

文字是保留信息重要的手段。
Writing is a method for storing information through material signs. 
Exactly how the brain does it remains a mystery, but we all know that the brain’s retrieval system is amazingly e cient, except when you are trying to remember where you put your car keys.
Clearly, just imprinting a document in clay is not enough to guarantee e cient, accurate and convenient data processing. That requires methods of organisation like catalogues, methods of reproduction like photocopy machines, methods of rapid and accurate retrieval like computer algorithms, and pedantic (but hopefully cheerful) librarians who know how to use these tools.
But the Arabs get the credit because when they invaded India they encountered the system, understood its usefulness, re ned it, and spread it through the Middle East and then to Europe. 
Although this system of writing remains a partial script, it has become the world’s dominant language.

#### 历史没有公正

UNDERSTANDING HUMAN HISTORY IN THE millennia following the Agricultural Revolution boils down to a single question: how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts necessary to sustain such networks? The short answer is that humans created imagined orders and devised scripts. These two inventions  lled the gaps left by our biological inheritance.
在农业革命背景下，我们成功的进化依靠的是想象出来的秩序和描述的手法。

Yet it is an iron rule of history that every imagined hierarchy disavows its  ctional origins and claims to be natural and inevitable. 
Between blacks and whites there are some objective biological di erences, such as skin colour and hair type, but there is no evidence that the differences extend to intelligence or morality.
Unfortunately, complex human societies seem to require imagined hierarchies and unjust discrimination. 
Hierarchies serve an important function. They enable complete strangers to know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy needed to become personally acquainted.
Of course, di erences in natural abilities also play a role in the formation of social distinctions. But such diversities of aptitudes and character are usually mediated through imagined hierarchies. This happens in two important ways. First and foremost, most abilities have to be nurtured and developed.
Second, even if people belonging to di erent classes develop exactly the same abilities, they are unlikely to enjoy equal success because they will have to play the game by di erent rules.
In most cases the hierarchy originated as the result of a set of accidental historical circumstances and was then perpetuated and refined over many generations as different groups developed vested interests in it.
If you want to keep any human group isolated – women, Jews, Roma, gays, blacks – the best way to do it is convince everyone that these people are a source of pollution.
In the early nineteenth century imperial Britain outlawed slavery and stopped the Atlantic slave trade, and in the decades that followed slavery was gradually outlawed throughout the American continent. Notably, this was the  rst and only time in history that slaveholding societies voluntarily abolished slavery. But, even though the slaves were freed, the racist myths that justi ed slavery persisted. Separation of the races was maintained by racist legislation and social custom.
By 1865 whites, as well as many blacks, took it to be a simple matter of fact that blacks were less intelligent, more violent and sexually dissolute, lazier and less concerned about personal cleanliness than whites.
You might think that people would gradually understand that these stigmas were myth rather than fact and that blacks would be able, over time, to prove themselves just as competent, law-abiding and clean as whites. In fact, the opposite happened – these prejudices became more and more entrenched as time went by. 
One hierarchy, however, has been of supreme importance in all known human societies: the hierarchy of gender. People everywhere have divided themselves into men and women. And almost everywhere men have got the better deal, at least since the Agricultural Revolution.
In many societies women were simply the property of men, most often their fathers, husbands or brothers. 
Yet around this hard universal kernel, every society accumulated layer upon layer of cultural ideas and norms that have little to do with biology. Societies associate a host of attributes with masculinity and femininity that, for the most part, lack a  rm biological basis.
How can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people merely try to justify through biological myths? A good rule of thumb is ‘**Biology enables, Culture forbids**.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide spectrum of possibilities. It’s culture that obliges people to realise some possibilities while forbidding others. 
To make things less confusing, scholars usually distinguish between ‘sex’, which is a biological category, and ‘gender’, a cultural category. Sex is divided between males and females, and the qualities of this division are objective and have remained constant throughout history. Gender is divided between men and women (and some cultures recognise other categories).
农业革命的不公正。人种、性别

为什么是男人？
In fact, human history shows that there is often an inverse relation between physical prowess and social power. 
Another theory explains that masculine dominance results not from strength but from aggression. 
men indeed have more aggressive and violent tendencies, and are therefore, on average, better suited to serve as common soldiers. 
As men competed against each other for the opportunity to impregnate fertile women, an individual’s chances of reproduction depended above all on his ability to outperform and defeat other men. As time went by, the masculine genes that made it to the next generation were those belonging to the most ambitious, aggressive and competitive men.
As time went by, the feminine genes that made it to the next generation belonged to women who were submissive caretakers.

### Part Three Unification of Humankind

#### 历史的方向

文化不同，与外界相互影响，在内部同样在进化。
AFTER THE AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION, human societies grew ever larger and more complex, while the imagined constructs sustaining the social order also became more elaborate. Myths and  ctions accustomed people, nearly from the moment of birth, to think in certain ways, to behave in accordance with certain standards, to want certain things, and to observe certain rules. They thereby created arti cial instincts that enabled millions of strangers to cooperate effectively. This network of artificial instincts is called culture.
Today, most scholars of culture have concluded that the opposite is true. Every culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values, but these are in constant  ux. The culture may transform itself in response to changes in its environment or through interaction with neighbouring cultures. But cultures also undergo transitions due to their own internal dynamics. Even a completely isolated culture existing in an ecologically stable environment cannot avoid change. Unlike the laws of physics, which are free of inconsistencies, every man-made order is packed with internal contradictions. Cultures are constantly trying to reconcile these contradictions, and this process fuels change.
If tensions, con icts and irresolvable dilemmas are the spice of every culture, a human being who belongs to any particular culture must hold contradictory beliefs and be riven by incompatible values. It’s such an essential feature of any culture that it even has a name: cognitive dissonance. 

历史的进化总是朝着某一个方向进行
The answer is yes. Over the millennia, small, simple cultures gradually coalesce into bigger and more complex civilisations, so that the world contains fewer and fewer mega-cultures, each of which is bigger and more complex. 
The best way to appreciate the general direction of history is to count the number of separate human worlds that coexisted at any given moment on planet Earth.
It took the Afro-Asian giant several centuries to digest all that it had swallowed, but the process was irreversible.
The single global culture is not homogeneous. Just as a single organic body contains many di erent kinds of organs and cells, so our single global culture contains many di erent types of lifestyles and people, 

beginning with the Cognitive Revolution, Homo sapiens became more and more exceptional in this respect. People began to cooperate on a regular basis with complete strangers, whom they imagined as ‘brothers’ or ‘friends’. Yet this brotherhood was not universal. Somewhere in the next valley, or beyond the mountain range, one could still sense ‘them’. 
Everyone was ‘us’, at least potentially. There was no longer ‘them’. The  rst universal order to appear was economic: the monetary order. The second universal order was political: the imperial order. The third universal order was religious: the order of universal religions such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam.
认知革命让我们开始区别敌人于自我。

#### 金钱的作用
什么是金钱
An economy of favours and obligations doesn’t work when large numbers of strangers try to cooperate.
‘Everyone would work according to their abilities, and receive according to their needs’ turned out in practice into ‘everyone would work as little as they can get away with, and receive as much as they could grab’.
Money is anything that people are willing to use in order to represent systematically the value of other things for the purpose of exchanging goods and services. 
In modern prisons and POW camps, cigarettes have often served as money.
More than 90 per cent of all money – more than $50 trillion appearing in our accounts – exists only on computer servers. 
Money is thus a universal medium of exchange that enables people to convert almost everything into almost anything else.
Ideal types of money enable people not merely to turn one thing into another, but to store wealth as well.

金钱如何工作
In other words, money isn’t a material reality – it is a psychological construct. It works by converting matter into mind. 
Trust is the raw material from which all types of money are minted.
The shape and size of the mark varied tremendously throughout history, but the message was always the same: ‘I, the Great King So-And-So, give you my personal word that this metal disc contains exactly  ve grams of gold. If anyone dares counterfeit this coin, it means he is fabricating my own signature, which would be a blot on my reputation. I will punish such a crime with the utmost severity.’
whereas religion asks us to believe in something, money asks us to believe that other people believe in something.
For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers and prophets have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may, money is also the apogee of human tolerance. 
Money is based on two universal principles:
a. Universal convertibility: with money as an alchemist, you can turn land into
loyalty, justice into health, and violence into knowledge.
b. Universal trust: with money as a go-between, any two people can cooperate on any project. 
These principles have enabled millions of strangers to cooperate e ectively in trade and industry. But these seemingly benign principles have a dark side. When everything is convertible, and when trust depends on anonymous coins and cowry shells, it corrodes local traditions, intimate relations and human values, replacing them with the cold laws of supply and demand.

在我看来，金钱作为一个虚拟的事物，作用在于能够衡量不同事物的价值。通俗的来说，它的存在是一个度量衡。能够区别开谁更好。人类的发展中很重要的一个因素就是我们彼此相互信任。所以，除了少数具体事物之外的事物，都是靠这些信任来维持。


#### 帝国的作用
什么是帝国
An empire is a political order with two important characteristics. First, to qualify for that designation you have to rule over a signi cant number of distinct peoples, each possessing a di erent cultural identity and a separate territory. How many peoples exactly? Two or three is not su cient. Twenty or thirty is plenty. The imperial threshold passes somewhere in between.
Second, empires are characterised by  exible borders and a potentially unlimited appetite. 
It should be stressed that an empire is de ned solely by its cultural diversity and  exible borders, rather than by its origins, its form of government, its territorial extent, or the size of its population.
Empires were one of the main reasons for the drastic reduction in human diversity. The imperial steamroller gradually obliterated the unique characteristics of numerous peoples (such as the Numantians), forging out of them new and much larger groups.

帝国 = 邪恶？
In our time, ‘imperialist’ ranks second only to ‘fascist’ in the lexicon of political swear words. The contemporary critique of empires commonly takes two forms:
1.Empires do not work. In the long run, it is not possible to rule e ectively over a large number of conquered peoples.
2.Even if it can be done, it should not be done, because empires are evil engines of destruction and exploitation. Every people has a right to self- determination, and should never be subject to the rule of another.
Building and maintaining an empire usually required the vicious slaughter of large populations and the brutal oppression of everyone who was left.
Imperial elites used the pro ts of conquest to  nance not only armies and forts but also philosophy, art, justice and charity. A signi cant proportion of humanity’s cultural achievements owe their existence to the exploitation of conquered populations.
Today most of us speak, think and dream in imperial languages that were forced upon our ancestors by the sword.
Often enough, it was the empires themselves which deliberately spread ideas, institutions, customs and norms. One reason was to make life easier for themselves. It is di cult to rule an empire in which every little district has its own set of laws, its own form of writing, its own language and its own money.
The cultural ideas spread by empire were seldom the exclusive creation of the ruling elite.Since the imperial vision tends to be universal and inclusive, it was relatively easy for imperial elites to adopt ideas, norms and traditions from wherever they found them, rather than to stick fanatically to a single hidebound tradition
All human cultures are at least in part the legacy of empires and imperial civilisations, and no academic or political surgery can cut out the imperial legacies without killing the patient.

在我看来，帝国的存在极大的促进了人类统一的过程。物品、语言、文化等等。试想，如果没有强权，我们的语言都不会统一。

#### 宗教的作用
其实宗教统一程度很高，但一开始，宗教的影响都是局部的部落
Today religion is often considered a source of discrimination, disagreement and disunion. Yet, in fact, religion has been the third great uni er of humankind, alongside money and empires. 
Religions assert that our laws are not the result of human caprice, but are ordained by an absolute and supreme authority. This helps place at least some fundamental laws beyond challenge, thereby ensuring social stability.
Religion can thus be de ned as a system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order.
In order to unite under its aegis a large expanse of territory inhabited by disparate groups of human beings, a religion must possess two further qualities. First, it must espouse a universal superhuman order that is true always and everywhere. Second, it must insist on spreading this belief to everyone. In other words, it must be universal and missionary.
The best-known religions of history, such as Islam and Buddhism, are universal and missionary. Consequently people tend to believe that all religions are like them. In fact, the majority of ancient religions were local and exclusive.

宗教，是人类对希望的寄托
The Agricultural Revolution seems to have been accompanied by a religious revolution. 
Hence the  rst religious e ect of the Agricultural Revolution was to turn plants and animals from equal members of a spiritual round table into property.
This, however, created a big problem. Farmers may have desired absolute control of their sheep, but they knew perfectly well that their control was limited.
A leading theory about the origin of the gods argues that gods gained importance because they o ered a solution to this problem.
These religions understood the world to be controlled by a group of powerful gods, such as the fertility goddess, the rain god and the war god. Humans could appeal to these gods and the gods might, if they received devotions and sacri ces, deign to bring rain, victory and health.
Animists thought that humans were just one of many creatures inhabiting the world. Polytheists, on the other hand, increasingly saw the world as a re ection of the relationship between gods and humans.

宗教进化史：多个，单个 -> God is One
The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism, is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases, and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of humans. It’s pointless to ask this power for victory in war, for health or for rain, because from its all-encompassing vantage point, it makes no di erence whether a particular kingdom wins or loses, whether a particular city prospers or withers, whether a particular person recuperates or dies. The Greeks did not waste any sacrifices on Fate, and Hindus built no temples to Atman.
The only reason to approach the supreme power of the universe would be to renounce all desires and embrace the bad along with the good – to embrace even defeat, poverty, sickness and death. 
Polytheism is inherently open-minded, and rarely persecutes ‘heretics’ and ‘infidels’.
Even when polytheists conquered huge empires, they did not try to convert their subjects. 
Subject peoples throughout the empire were expected to respect the empire’s gods and rituals, since these gods and rituals protected and legitimised the empire. Yet they were not required to give up their local gods and rituals. 
When the Christians vehemently refused to do so, and went on to reject all attempts at compromise, the Romans reacted by persecuting what they understood to be a politically subversive faction.
With time some followers of polytheist gods became so fond of their particular patron that they drifted away from the basic polytheist insight. They began to believe that their god was the only god, and that He was in fact the supreme power of the universe.
It was thus necessary to spread the good word – the gospel – about Jesus throughout the world.
Like Christianity, Islam, too, began as a small sect in a remote corner of the world, but in an even stranger and swifter historical surprise it managed to break out of the deserts of Arabia and conquer an immense empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to India. Henceforth, the monotheist idea played a central role in world history.
Monotheists have tended to be far more fanatical and missionary than polytheists. 

自然的法则
All the religions we have discussed so far share one important characteristic: they all focus on a belief in gods and other supernatural entities.
These creeds maintained that the superhuman order governing the world is the product of natural laws rather than of divine wills and whims.
Rather, su ering is caused by the behaviour patterns of one’s own mind.
Gautama’s insight was that no matter what the mind experiences, it usually reacts with craving, and craving always involves dissatisfaction.
We either fear that the pleasure might disappear, or we hope that it will intensify.
If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no su ering. If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not su er from it. There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind.
He encapsulated his teachings in a single law: su ering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from su ering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is.
The Nazis did not loathe humanity. They fought liberal humanism, human rights and Communism precisely because they admired humanity and believed in the great potential of the human species. But following the logic of Darwinian evolution, they argued that natural selection must be allowed to weed out un t individuals and leave only the  ttest to survive and reproduce. By succouring the weak, liberalism and Communism not only allowed un t individuals to survive, they actually gave them the opportunity to reproduce, thereby undermining natural selection. In such a world, the  ttest humans would inevitably drown in a sea of un t degenerates. Humankind would become less and less  t with each passing generation – which could lead to its extinction.

人类成功的秘密
But saying that a global society is inevitable is not the same as saying that the end result had to be the particular kind of global society we now have.
What is the di erence between describing ‘how’ and explaining ‘why’? To describe ‘how’ means to reconstruct the series of speci c events that led from one point to another. To explain ‘why means to  nd causal connections that account for the occurrence of this particular series of events to the exclusion of all others.
It is an iron rule of history that what looks inevitable in hindsight was far from obvious at the time. Today is no di erent. 
It is particularly important to stress that possibilities which seem very unlikely to contemporaries often get realised.
To acknowledge that history is not deterministic is to acknowledge that it is just a coincidence that most people today believe in nationalism, capitalism and human rights.
Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. 
We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine. 
We cannot explain the choices that history makes, but we can say something very important about them: history’s choices are not made for the bene t of humans.
Ever more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or parasite, with humans as its unwitting host.
History proceeds from one junction to the next, choosing for some mysterious reason to follow  rst this path, then another. 

在我看来，宗教最大的作用就是让一些毫无相关的人，可以通过一些虚拟的事情，达成一致。同时，也正是想让更多的人知道自己宗教的好处的想法，促进了人类的统一，即使是纳粹。人们将自己的贪婪，寄托于宗教。我们赋予神的功能也正是我们所的希望。

### Part Four Scientific Revolution
#### 科技革命始于我们发现自己的无知
The last 500 years have witnessed a phenomenal and unprecedented growth in human power. 
The historical process that led to Alamogordo and to the moon is known as the Scienti c Revolution. During this revolution humankind has obtained enormous new powers by investing resources in scienti c research.
During the last  ve centuries, humans increasingly came to believe that they could increase their capabilities by investing in scienti c research. This wasn’t just blind faith – it was repeatedly proven empirically. The more proofs there were, the more resources wealthy people and governments were willing to put into science. 
Humans have sought to understand the universe at least since the Cognitive Revolution. Our ancestors put a great deal of time and e ort into trying to discover the rules that govern the natural world. But modern science di ers from all previous traditions of knowledge in three critical ways:
a. The willingness to admit ignorance. Modern science is based on the Latin injunction ignoramus – ‘we do not know’. It assumes that we don’t know everything. Even more critically, it accepts that the things that we think we know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No concept, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge.
b. The centrality of observation and mathematics. Having admitted ignorance, modern science aims to obtain new knowledge. It does so by gathering observations and then using mathematical tools to connect these observations into comprehensive theories.
c. The acquisition of new powers. Modern science is not content with creating theories. It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular to develop new technologies.
The great discovery that launched the Scienti c Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions.
Ancient traditions of knowledge admitted only two kinds of ignorance. First, an individual might be ignorant of something important. To obtain the necessary knowledge, all he needed to do was ask somebody wiser. There was no need to discover something that nobody yet knew. Second, an entire tradition might be ignorant of unimportant things. By de nition, whatever the great gods or the wise people of the past did not bother to tell us was unimportant. 
In every age, even the most pious and conservative, there were people who argued that there were important things of which theirentire tradition was ignorant. Yet such people were usually marginalised or persecuted – or else they founded a new tradition and began arguing that they knew everything there is to know. 
Modern-day science is a unique tradition of knowledge, inasmuch as it openly admits collective ignorance regarding the most important questions.
The willingness to admit ignorance has made modern science more dynamic, supple and inquisitive than any previous tradition of knowledge. This has hugely expanded our capacity to understand how the world works and our ability to invent new technologies. 
All modern attempts to stabilise the sociopolitical order have had no choice but to rely on either of two unscientific methods:
a. Take a scienti c theory, and in opposition to common scienti c practices, declare that it is a  nal and absolute truth. This was the method used by Nazis (who claimed that their racial policies were the corollaries of biological facts) and Communists (who claimed that Marx and Lenin had divined absolute economic truths that could never be refuted).
b. Leave science out of it and live in accordance with a non-scienti c absolute truth. This has been the strategy of liberal humanism, which is built on a dogmatic belief in the unique worth and rights of human beings – a doctrine which has embarrassingly little in common with the scientific study of Homo sapiens.

科学的教义-控制实验
Modern science has no dogma. Yet it has a common core of research methods, which are all based on collecting empirical observations Why waste precious resources obtaining new observations when we already have all the answers we need? But as modern people came to admit that they did not know the answers to some very important questions, they found it necessary to look forcompletely new knowledge. Consequently, the dominant modern research method takes for granted the insu ciency of old knowledge. Instead of studying old traditions, emphasis is now placed on new observations and experiments. When present observation collides with past tradition, we give precedence to the observation. 
Mere observations, however, are not knowledge. In order to understand the universe, we need to connect observations into comprehensive theories. Earlier traditions usually formulated their theories in terms of stories. Modern science uses mathematics.
A new branch of mathematics was developed over the last 200 years to deal with the more complex aspects of reality: statistics.

知识就是力量
Science nevertheless enjoys immense prestige because of the new powers it gives us. Presidents and generals may not understand nuclear physics, but they have a good grasp of what nuclear bombs can do.
The real test of ‘knowledge’ is not whether it is true, but whether it empowers us. Scientists usually assume that no theory is 100 per cent correct. Consequently, truth is a poor test for knowledge. The real test is utility. A theory that enables us to do new things constitutes knowledge.
Here and there people did develop new technologies, but these were usually created by uneducated craftsmen using trial and error, not by scholars pursuing systematic scienti c research.
Science, industry and military technology intertwined only with the advent of the capitalist system and the Industrial Revolution. Once this relationship was established, however, it quickly transformed the world.
When modern culture admitted that there were many important things that it still did not know, and when that admission of ignorance was married to the idea that scienti c discoveries could give us new powers, people began suspecting that real progress might be possible after all. 
Of all mankind’s ostensibly insoluble problems, one has remained the most vexing, interesting and important: the problem of death itself.
Disciples of progress do not share this defeatist attitude.
The leading project of the Scienti c Revolution is to give humankind eternal life. Even if killing death seems a distant goal, we have already achieved things that were inconceivable a few centuries ago.
science is not an enterprise that takes place on some superior moral or spiritual plane above the rest of human activity. Like all other parts of our culture, it is shaped by economic, political and religious interests.
Most scienti c studies are funded because somebody believes they can help attain some political, economic or religious goal.
Even if we wanted to  nance pure science una ected by political, economic or religious interests, it would probably be impossible. Our resources are limited, after all. 
Science is unable to set its own priorities. It is also incapable of determining what to do with its discoveries.
In short, scienti c research can  ourish only in alliance with some religion or ideology. The ideology justi es the costs of the research. In exchange, the ideology in uences the scienti c agenda and determines what to do with the discoveries.

#### 科技与帝国： 共赢
How did the people of this frigid  nger of Eurasia manage to break out of their remote corner of the globe and conquer the entire world? Europe’s scientists are often given much of the credit. It’s unquestionable that from 1850 onward European domination rested to a large extent on the military–industrial–scienti c complex and technological wizardry.
The Chinese and Persians did not lack technological inventions such as steam engines (which could be freely copied or bought). They lacked the values, myths, judicial apparatus and sociopolitical structures that took centuries to form and mature in the West and which could not be copied and internalised rapidly.
What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it to dominate the late modern world? There are two complementary answers to this question: modern science and capitalism.
What forged the historical bond between modern science and European imperialism? Technology was an important factor in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but in the early modern era it was of limited importance. The key factor was that the plant-seeking botanist and the colony-seeking naval o cer shared a similar mindset. Both scientist and conqueror began by admitting ignorance – they both said, ‘I don’t know what’s out there.’ They both felt compelled to go out and make new discoveries. And they both hoped the new knowledge thus acquired would make them masters of the world.
European imperialists set out to distant shores in the hope of obtaining new knowledge along with new territories.
The modern ‘explore and conquer’ mentality is nicely illustrated by the development of world maps.
The  rst modern man was Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian sailor who took part in several expeditions to America in the years 1499–1504. 
Throughout history most human societies were so busy with local con icts and neighbourhood quarrels that they never considered exploring and conquering distant lands.
Yet there was a crucial di erence. Zheng He explored the oceans, and assisted pro-Chinese rulers, but he did not try to conquer or colonise the countries he visited. Moreover, the expeditions of Zheng He were not deeply rooted in Chinese politics and culture. When the ruling faction in Beijing changed during the 1430s, the new overlords abruptly terminated the operation. The great  eet was dismantled, crucial technical and geographical knowledge was lost, and no explorer of such stature and means ever set out again from a Chinese port. Chinese rulers in the coming centuries, like most Chinese rulers in previous centuries, restricted their interests and ambitions to the Middle Kingdom’s immediate environs.
The Zheng He expeditions prove that Europe did not enjoy an outstanding technological edge. What made Europeans exceptional was their unparalleled and insatiable ambition to explore and conquer.
Instead of concentrating all available forces and wiping out the Spaniards, the Aztecs deliberated, dawdled and negotiated. They saw no reason to rush. After all, Cortés had no more than 550 Spaniards with him. What could 550 men do to an empire of millions?
Cortés was equally ignorant about the Aztecs, but he and his men held signi cant advantages over their adversaries. While the Aztecs had no experience to prepare them for the arrival of these strange-looking and foul-smelling aliens, the Spaniards knew that the earth was full of unknown human realms, and no one had greater expertise in invading alien lands and dealing with situations about which they were utterly ignorant. For the modern European conqueror, like the modern European scientist, plunging into the unknown was exhilarating.

但是，获利的并不是所有人
Modern science and modern empires were motivated by the restless feeling that perhaps something important awaited beyond the horizon – something they had better explore and master. Yet the connection between science and empire went much deeper. Not just the motivation, but also the practices of empire-builders were entangled with those of scientists.
European conquerors knew their empires very well. Far better, indeed, than any previous conquerors, or even than the native population itself. Their superior knowledge had obvious practical advantages. 
Yet these practical advantages were not the only reason why empires  nanced the study of linguistics, botany, geography and history. No less important was the fact that science gave the empires ideological justi cation. Modern Europeans came to believe that acquiring new knowledge was always good. The fact that the empires produced a constant stream of new knowledge branded them as progressive and positive enterprises.
But science was also used by imperialists to more sinister ends. Biologists, anthropologists and even linguists provided scienti c proof that Europeans are superior to all other races, and consequently have the right (if not perhaps the duty) to rule over them.
Scientists have provided the imperial project with practical knowledge, ideological justi cation and technological gadgets
Science was supported by other institutions, not just by empires. And the European empires rose and  ourished thanks also to factors other than science. Behind the meteoric rise of both science and empire lurks one particularly important force: capitalism.

#### 资本主义教条
现在的社会，充斥着资本的泡沫。而这个泡沫，靠着信任维持；靠消费扩张。
Yet to understand modern economic history, you really need to understand just a single word. The word is growth. For better or worse, in sickness and in health, the modern economy has been growing like a hormone-soused teenager. It eats up everything it can  nd and puts on inches faster than you can count.
Banks are allowed to loan $10 for every dollar they actually possess, which means that 90 per cent of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by actual coins and notes
The entire enterprise is thus founded on trust in an imaginary future 
In most cases, money could represent and convert only things that actually existed in the present. This imposed a severe limitation on growth, since it made it very hard to  nance new enterprises.
The way out of the trap was discovered only in the modern era, with the appearance of a new system based on trust in the future. 
It was that people seldom wanted to extend much credit because they didn’t trust that the future would be better than the present. They generally believed that times past had been better than their own times and that the future would be worse, or at best much the same. 
Then came the Scienti c Revolution and the idea of progress. The idea of progress is built on the notion that if we admit our ignorance and invest resources in research, things can improve. This idea was soon translated into economic terms. Whoever believes in progress believes that geographical discoveries, technological inventions and organisational developments can increase the sum total of human production, trade and wealth. New trade routes in the Atlantic could  ourish without ruining old routes in the Indian Ocean. New goods could be produced without reducing the production of old ones.
It follows that an increase in the pro ts of private entrepreneurs is the basis for the increase in collective wealth and prosperity.
Capitalism distinguishes ‘capital’ from mere ‘wealth’. Capital consists of money, goods and resources that are invested in production. Wealth, on the other hand, is buried in the ground or wasted on unproductive activities. 
The European conquest of the world was increasingly  nanced through credit rather than taxes, and was increasingly directed by capitalists whose main ambition was to receive maximum returns on their investments.
Decade by decade, western Europe witnessed the development of a sophisticated  nancial system that could raise large amounts of credit on short notice and put it at the disposal of private entrepreneurs and governments.
The amount of credit in an economy is determined not only by purely economic factors such as the discovery of a new oil  eld or the invention of a new machine, but also by political events such as regime changes or more ambitious foreign policies. 
The most important economic resource is trust in the future, and this resource is constantly threatened by thieves and charlatans. Markets by themselves o er no protection against fraud, theft and violence. It is the job of political systems to ensure trust by legislating sanctions against cheats and to establish and support police forces, courts and jails which will enforce the law. 
It cannot ensure that pro ts are gained in a fair way, or distributed in a fair manner. On the contrary, the craving to increase pro ts and production blinds people to anything that might stand in the way. When growth becomes a supreme good, unrestricted by any other ethical considerations, it can easily lead to catastrophe.
The Industrial Revolution that swept through Europe enriched the bankers and capital- owners, but condemned millions of workers to a life of abject poverty.

#### 革命不息
As we saw in the previous chapter, the resources available to humankind are constantly increasing, and are likely to continue to do so.
Many call this process ‘the destruction of nature’. But it’s not really destruction, it’s change. Nature cannot be destroyed.
The Industrial Revolution turned the timetable and the assembly line into a template for almost all human activities. Shortly after factories imposed their time frames on human behaviour, schools too adopted precise timetables, followed by hospitals, government o ces and grocery stores. Even in places devoid of assembly lines and machines, the timetable became king. 
As best we can tell, from the earliest times, more than a million years ago, humans lived in small, intimate communities, most of whose members were kin. The Cognitive Revolution and the Agricultural Revolution did not change that. They glued together families and communities to create tribes, cities, kingdoms and empires, but families and communities remained the basic building blocks of all human societies. The Industrial Revolution, on the other hand, managed within little more than two centuries to break these building blocks into atoms. Most of the traditional functions of families and communities were handed over to states and markets.
The Industrial Revolution gave the market immense new powers, provided the state with new means of communication and transportation, and placed at the government’s disposal an army of clerks, teachers, policemen and social workers.
The state and the market are the mother and father of the individual, and the individual can survive only thanks to them.
Not only adult men, but also women and children, are recognised as individuals. Throughout most of history, women were often seen as the property of family or community. Modern states, on the other hand, see women as individuals, enjoying economic and legal rights independently of their family and community.
The nuclear family did not disappear completely from the modern landscape. When states and markets took from the family most of its economic and political roles, they left it some important emotional functions.
An imagined community is a community of people who don’t really know each other, but imagine that they do. 
Consumerism and nationalism work extra hours to make us imagine that millions of strangers belong to the same community as ourselves, that we all have a common past, common interests and a common future.
Hence any attempt to de ne the characteristics of modern society is akin to de ning the colour of a chameleon. The only characteristic of which we can be certain is the incessant change.
Even more importantly, it’s easier to relate to the su ering of individuals than of entire populations.
Scholars have sought to explain this happy development in more books and articles than you would ever want to read yourself, and they have identi ed several contributing factors. First and foremost, the price of war has gone up dramatically.
Secondly, while the price of war soared, its pro ts declined. For most of history, polities could enrich themselves by looting or annexing enemy territories.
While war became less pro table, peace became more lucrative than ever.
Last but not least, a tectonic shift has taken place in global political culture.
To satisfy both optimists and pessimists, we may conclude by saying that we are on the threshold of both heaven and hell, moving nervously between the gateway of the one and the anteroom of the other.

#### 现代社会的不足：快乐度更低、生病率更高
Power corrupts, they say, and as humankind gained more and more power, it created a cold mechanistic world ill-suited to our real needs. 
One interesting conclusion is that money does indeed bring happiness. But only up to a point, and beyond that point it has little signi cance.
Another interesting  nding is that illness decreases happiness in the short term, but is a source of long-term distress only if a person’s condition is constantly deteriorating or if the disease involves ongoing and debilitating pain.
Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health.
But the most important  nding of all is that happiness does not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations.
If happiness is determined by expectations, then two pillars of our society – mass media and the advertising industry – may unwittingly be depleting the globe’s reservoirs of contentment.
So maybe Third World discontent is fomented not merely by poverty, disease, corruption and political oppression but also by mere exposure to First World standards.
But the tiny minority able to a ord the new treatments will not be euphoric either. They will have much to be anxious about.
A person who just won the lottery or found new love and jumps from joy is not really reacting to the money or the lover. She is reacting to various hormones coursing through her bloodstream, and to the storm of electric signals  ashing between di erent parts of her brain.
It enables us to enjoy a momentary rush of pleasant sensations, but these never last for ever. Sooner or later they subside and give place to unpleasant sensations.
If we accept the biological approach to happiness, then history turns out to be of minor importance, since most historical events have had no impact on our biochemistry.
So perhaps happiness is synchronising one’s personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions.
Both the above views share the assumption that happiness is some sort of subjective feeling (of either pleasure or meaning), and that in order to judge people’s happiness, all we need to do is ask them how they feel. 
Rather, the real root of su ering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction.

科技革命之前，我们认为我们什么都知道。不知道的东西就用宗教来寄托。农业革命让我们人口增加，迫使我们去探索更多的领域。于是，我们认识到了自己的无知。这种对未知问题的向往，极大的促进了科技的进步。当我们知道的越多，我们发现自己的不知道的越多。于是，我们更有动力去发现新的知识。这些新发现的知识，也同样的，促进我们的进步。为了追求更多的知识，我们发动战争、掠夺，发展资本主义。但无疑，这些都造就了今天的人类社会。
