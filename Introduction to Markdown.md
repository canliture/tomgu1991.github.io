> Prologue: This is  a reference for markdown. You can download the .md file to check how to write markdown. It also can be used as a quick check reference, for you can see the output quickly and focus on what you need.

### 1. Header(#)
Create a heading by adding one or more `#`

### 2. Paragraph
Paragraph in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.

### 3. Details
#### 3.1 Quote(>)
Using `>` indicate quotes.
> using > indicate quotes.

#### 3.2 Bold and Italic(*_ **)
Using `*` as italic. 
Using `**` as bold. For _example_,
*Italic* **Bold**. 
**Everyone _must_ attend the meeting at 5 o'clock today.**

#### 3.3 list
You can make an ordered list by preceding list items with a number.

**Ordered list:**

1. Item 1-using number and '.' like '1.' as ordered list
2. Item 2-using '* or -' as unordered list like
3. Item 3- make them together as nested list

**Unorderd list:**

- Item1
- Item2
* Item3

**Nested lists**

1. Item 1
  1. A corollary to the above item.
  2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
    * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
    * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3

#### 3.4 Code formatting("`")
**Inline formats:**
Here's an idea: why don't we take `SuperiorProject` and turn it into `**Reasonable**Project`.

**Multiple lines:**
Check out this neat program I wrote:
```
x = 0
x = 2 + 2
what is x
```

#### 3.5 Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets ( `[ ]` ), and then wrapping the link in parentheses ( `( )` ).

For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](https://www.github.com).

#### 3.6 Marks
**Highlight**
We can use double `=`  to highlight the key words.
==hightlight==

**Mistake**
We can use double `~` to line the work.
~~hello~~

#### check box
* [ ] Use `[ ]` for not done
* [x] Use `[x]` for done 

#### 3.7 Table
Using the following way to create a table
```
one|two|three
-|-|-
1|2|3
```
one|two|three
-|-|-
1|2|3
